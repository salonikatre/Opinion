                    "Well, there is no dearth of scholarship, or the continual production of books, edited volumes and academic papers on Gandhi—from “postcolonial”/“postmodern” Gandhi to the reflections on “the doctor and the saint”, or Gandhi through Dr B R Ambedkar’s eyes. Yet, as a teacher, I have often felt that there is something beyond these heavily loaded discourses. Indeed, young students ought to be reminded of a simple fact: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was not a scholar — the way some of our distinguished historians and political philosophers are; nor did he communicate his ideas in the way they do. Instead, his books Hind Swaraj, My Experiments with Truth and his writings in Young India and Harijan are amazingly “simple”.Furthermore, unlike a university scholar, he didn’t “theorise”. In fact, his writings, unlike a “value-neutral”/“peer reviewed” research paper, were inseparable from his politico-spiritual experiments, his self-reflections and vulnerabilities, and above all, the moral/ethical churning he passed through throughout his life. And hence, I feel, it would not be a good pedagogic practice if we reduce Gandhi into yet another academic puzzle to be solved in the classroom. Nor should Gandhi be reduced to, as schools often do, a discrete chapter in the history textbook, or an object of “moral education” that children seldom identify with.",

But it is essential to discover, rewrite and reinterpret the role and representation of these heroic women in the liberation of the motherland. Such rewriting and reinterpretation might also provide a method to deal with the reactionary and androcentric approach of society.",

In both nuclear and non-nuclear families, socioeconomic status determines the amount and quality of the interactions children have in their early life — this translates to significant developmental advantages depending on the household into which a child is born. The school environment can mitigate socioeconomic deprivation to an extent. For that to happen, schools have to be functional. ",

Now, with technology providing instant recall, a voice is a living presence; but in an age when music was memory, how did one pay homage to a lost voice?
